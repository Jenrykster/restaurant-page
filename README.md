# Restaurant page project

This is the repository for my take on the [Restaurant Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page) project of  [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. 

The assignment consists of the following:

1. Setup my project on github
2. Setup [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
3. Create a HTML skeleton page with only a div
4. Add elements to the page using javascript ES6 modules
5. Create different tabs and organize them in different modules
6. Bundle the code with webpack loaders
7. Host the static page (I used [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) for this)
